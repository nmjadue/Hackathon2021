## Inspiration
The current pandemic spotlighted a major issue: lack of technological understanding among the elderly. While staying socially distant has been lonely for all of us, it becomes an even bigger issue when an individual adequately use their personal devices to stay connected. Even more troublesome is the fact that most covid vaccine appointments are scheduled online. Many of the elderly simply do not understan how to register themselves for an appointment, nor can they effectively use video chat to get help doing so. We wanted to create a "how-to" project to help the elderly learn how to use technology. For our initial protype, we centered around basic functions of a smartphone. However, the overarching purpose demands that this curriculum can expand into other vaccums of necessity. 

## What it does
Our website features gamification elements paired with traditional educational methods to teach the elderly how to use their smart phone. We started with the ever-simple quiz function. The questions attempt to move in a very detailed, chronological order to guide the user every step of the way from A-Z. We cover hardware, software, password security, browsing functions, camera, and posting to social media.

## How we built it
This project mostly uses Javascript, HTML, and CSS. 

###gitJavascript

The Javascript controls the functional aspects of the 
application. This includes navigation, button clicks, 
and displaying questions. We create a quiz container 
that can flip through slides (questions). This quiz 
container determines when to show which buttons, 
which question and answers to display, as well as
grades the user responses.  This code also contains 
the questions for each module.

## Challenges we ran into

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're very proud that we finished our product! Of course, we wanted to develop more questions and modules. However, we are very proud that we were able to complete so much development. Additionally, no one in our group has ever attended a Hackathon before. We are proud that we felt comfortable enough not only to sign up, but to finish a product.
