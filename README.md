## Inspiration
The current pandemic spotlighted a major issue: lack of technological understanding among the elderly. While staying socially distant has been lonely for all of us, it becomes an even bigger issue when an individual adequately use their personal devices to stay connected. Even more troublesome is the fact that most covid vaccine appointments are scheduled online. Many of the elderly simply do not understan how to register themselves for an appointment, nor can they effectively use video chat to get help doing so. We wanted to create a "how-to" project to help the elderly learn how to use technology. For our initial protype, we centered around basic functions of a smartphone. However, the overarching purpose demands that this curriculum can expand into other vaccums of necessity. 

## What it does
Our website features gamification elements paired with traditional educational methods to teach the elderly how to use their smart phone. We started with the ever-simple quiz function. The questions attempt to move in a very detailed, chronological order to guide the user every step of the way from A-Z. We cover hardware, software, password security, browsing functions, camera, and posting to social media.

## How we built it
This project mostly uses Javascript, HTML, and CSS. We used photoshop and figma to create the images. 

<b>Javascript </b>

The Javascript controls the functional aspects of the 
application. This includes navigation, button clicks, 
and displaying questions. We create a quiz container 
that can flip through slides (questions). This quiz 
container determines when to show which buttons, 
which question and answers to display, as well as
grades the user responses.  This code also contains 
the questions for each module.


## Challenges we ran into

Most of the challenges we had delt with not having the skills to implement the functionality we origianally intended. For example, instead of just asking a question and taking user answer, we wish we could have included other forms of questions. These would have been including images in the questions, creating matching questions, and further Gameifying this learning application. Since it was our first time programming in these languages, we weren't able to bring our vision to reality completely. Also, because of our limited programming experience in these languages, our code is not very effective. We have code that is not optimal and copied and pasted multiple times. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're very proud that we finished our product! Of course, we wanted to develop more questions and modules. However, we are very proud that we were able to complete so much development. Additionally, no one in our group has ever attended a Hackathon before. We are proud that we felt comfortable enough not only to sign up, but to finish a product.

## What we learned
<b> AnnaMaria's Takeaways: </b>
Through this project, I learned coding basics. I had zero coding experience before this Hackathon. My undergraduate degrees include English and Integrated Language Arts Education and I am currently pursing a Juris Doctorate. I became interested in coding as my school exposed me to the world of cybersecurity. While I understood some basic computer concepts, I struggled to understand exactly how anything actually functioned. Through this project, I learned about the process from idea to finished product. I also learned how code is used. I am excited to learn more about different coding languages to complete my own projects, now that I understand how to use them.

<b> Natalie's Takeaways: </b>
While I've been in the computer schienc and tech community for a while, this is my first Hackathon. I came into this experience intending to complete a project and have fun. Not only did I do that, but I learned some valueable programming skills with Javascript, CSS, and HTML. I also feel more confident attending future Hackathons.

## What's next for DigiTutor
<b> Improving Our Curriculum </b>
While our quiz provides some education, we need to include more prelimiary information. Our ideas for providing more information include showing a tutorial before the quiz. Furthermore, we wanted to include actual pictures of the icons or buttons that we wanted our users to press. This should help the user understand their device better.

<b> Including More Gamification </b>
We want our product to be fun! We created a character that can 'level up' as a user completes different modules. Ideally, that character can have a larger role.

<b> Adding Accessibility Modules </b>
As we know, many of our elderly struggle with hearing or visual impairments. Fortunately, many devices now include many tools to help navigate despite these issues. We would like to include a module to help users learn how to toggle these functions, then how to use them.
