Hello
## How we built it
This project mostly uses Javascript, HTML, and CSS. 

###Javascript

The Javascript controls the functional aspects of the 
application. This includes navigation, button clicks, 
and displaying questions. We create a quiz container 
that can flip through slides (questions). This quiz 
container determines when to show which buttons, 
which question and answers to display, as well as
grades the user responses.  This code also contains 
the questions for each module.
